"""Determinism golden gate + ``synth-authoring freeze`` (#28) — the load-bearing oracle.

The defining test of ``langfuse-synth-core``: ``seed + target_traces + declared params
-> byte-identical Spool``, proven **offline, before ingestion**, on the FULL materialized
payload (not IDs + a summary). This is stronger than internal repeatability: a fresh
materialization is compared byte-for-byte against a blessed golden snapshot, so any
refactor or story change that silently perturbs the pool fails loudly at author time.

Two capabilities, one machine:

* :func:`assert_golden` — the gate. Materializes the Spool under the deny-LLM egress
  block and asserts byte-identity against the blessed golden.
* :func:`freeze` — ``synth-authoring freeze``. Materializes the Spool under the same block and
  writes it as the blessed golden, so a *deliberate* pool change (including refreshing an
  author-time LLM-generated fixture) is one intentional re-bless — never a hand-edit.

Both run ``seed`` in a subprocess under :mod:`langfuse_synth_core.authoring.egress`, so
the gate simultaneously proves determinism AND model-free-at-seed-runtime.

The ``target_traces`` derivation hook that runs at seed time is NOT here — it ships in
the runtime library (:mod:`langfuse_synth_core.derivation`) and the kit's own ``seed``
calls it. This module lives behind the ``[authoring]`` extra.

Seed contract (kit-owned):
    ``seed(target_traces: int, params: Mapping[str, Any]) -> bytes``
    Returns the fully materialized Spool payload, deterministically. Referenced by a
    ``"module.path:function"`` string so the gate can run it in a fresh subprocess.
